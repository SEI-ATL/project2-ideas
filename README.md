# Project 2 Planning

Fork & Clone this repo.

## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://romebell.gitbook.io/sei-1019/projects/project-2) and check out some [examples](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/11-projects/past-projects/project2).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. H.I.I.T.S - Using [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/search/search/), allow users to suggest workout songs for their gym. 
    As a gym member, I want to search for songs by title, artist, or album, so I can find music for the gym.
    As a gym member, I want to recommend songs for the gym playlist, so the gym will play music I like.
    As a gym admin, I want to see a list of all songs recommended by gym members, so I can make my patrons workout more enjoyable. 
2. Thus Said - Using [FavQ API](https://favqs.com/api), users search for quotes. Able to save quotes to favorites, returned by subject. 
    As a user, I want to search for famous quotes by author so I can be smarter than I am now.
    As a user, I want to save quotes I love so that I can refer back to them later.
    BONUS As a user, I want to share a quote I love on Twitter. 
3. ChatChat - Using [IBM Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-assistant) create a chat bot to converse with on a range of topics. 
    As a user, I want to talk to a computer so I can see how close we are to passing the Turing test. 
    As a user, I want to pick a topic to chat with a bot about so I can keep the "conversations" interesting to me.
