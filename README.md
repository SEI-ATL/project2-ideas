Fork & Clone this repo.

## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://romebell.gitbook.io/sei-1019/projects/project-2) and check out some [examples](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/11-projects/past-projects/project2).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

1. FAMISHED
My idea for the APP is based on Google Maps Distance Matrix API. The API provides distance and travel time between 2 destinations. I want to use the DISTANCE value to reference food trucks within a set range of user’r location. 
We will run 2 tables one for users - one for food trucks. Both will have a location collumn.
Stage One -
The user will get alerts if a food truck registers in their area.We will have food truck register their address once they make a stop. Example: 420 St. Nicholas Avenue 10027. We will store our users locations as well and will find matches once a food truck checks into an area or the user changes their address. (the alert can have a menu attached - a great section you can always expand on).
Stage Two - (user can set parameters for what they are looking for; example Burgers, Price Range $10. The food truck owners can upload their menus into the database to we can match them with user’s preferences once the truck is in the range of the user. 
To me this is enough to start on and everything else is a stretch goal. I want to build a basic food sales app that I can later expand and work on after my course. I am motivated by it’s connection to the real world challenges - it’s hard to order from for trucks online and it would be great to have an app just for that, you could potentially tie this app to the delivery services which would be a huge incentive for truck owners to join and expand their business.
