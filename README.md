# Project 2 Planning

Fork & Clone this repo.

## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://romebell.gitbook.io/sei-1019/projects/project-2) and check out some [examples](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/11-projects/past-projects/project2).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. **Spectrum:** log your favorite songs (Spotify or SoundCloud). Find songs with similar frequency profiles using:

    A. audiomotion analyzer: https://www.npmjs.com/package/audiomotion-analyzer - this extracts all the frequency data
    
    B. Last.fm: https://www.last.fm/api or AcoustId: https://acoustid.org/webservice or Napster: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@percuss.io/soundslice-data-api
      (or Spotify: https://www.npmjs.com/package/spotify-web-api-node or SoundCloud: https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/reference)
      
    C. Would I only need a more basic music API if I'm going to be searching by frequency profile? Or would I need something like the "fingerprint" in AcoustId?
    
    D. Is it too complex to directly search for matching frequency profiles? Or could I just find a way to narrowly compare different songs?
    
    **User experience:** "As a user, I want to explore a new way of comparing the music that I like, and to search for different music that I might enjoy."
    
2. Something that explores an EEG data set: https://openneuro.org/public/datasets

    A. Find a type of activity in a database and visualize it? A user could log snapshots?
    
    **User experience:** As a user, I want to explore snippets of EEG data that match a particular profile."

3. Something that explores the http://www.soundslice.com music education API? https://www.npmjs.com/package/@percuss.io/soundslice-data-api
