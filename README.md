# Project 2 Planning

Fork & Clone this repo.

## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://romebell.gitbook.io/sei-1019/projects/project-2) and check out some [examples](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/11-projects/past-projects/project2).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
### MY 3 IDEAS
###### (IN ORDER OF PREFERENCE)
1. Snky or MyCloset - (API https://github.com/druv5319/Sneaks-API)

WHO - Users who want to keep inventory of what they have in the closet.

WHAT - They will be able to store their sneakers in what i can call mycloset and then able to add thier own images and comments and stories if they choose. Invite people to look at their profile and what they have maybe to trade or just browse. i might be able to add a second API like BarCode that can scan images you upload as a reach goal.

WHY - As a sneaker/shoe collector it can be hard to remember what you have all the time unless you have an inventory system. This will make it easier for users to see what they have and if they have more and are resellers, be able to check what they have in stock.

2. MyTify - (API https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)

WHO - Avid audiophiles or people who have stories based on music they listen to.

WHAT - User will be able to save a song they look up into a faves section and when they click on it be able to upload images and stories that remind them of that song or a memory attached to that song.

WHY - Everyone has mempries attach to everything we do. From people sayign certain things, to images and even smell. The most powerful is music. It has a way of not only reminding you of what was happning to a time you heard the song but also bring you back to that feeling. This will be a great way to document your life of music.

3. neighbourFood - (API https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation?csw=1)

WHO - Foodies that are always down to eat at new places.

WHAT - Users will be able to log in and find their list of restuarants they searched for and saved before using googles places API.This migth be places they went to eat before and can post a story. Similiar to a review sire but more personal for the user. Like a photo book of places they been to.

WHY - Similar to my second idea. This is a great way to documents places you been to eat. Like a collage of photos for couples or familys when they go out to eat new places. Could also be like a site to store memories to places you been in general, but that will just end up being too much like facebook in some ways.
