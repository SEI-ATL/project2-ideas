## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://romebell.gitbook.io/sei-1019/projects/project-2) and check out some [examples](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/11-projects/past-projects/project2).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. WHAT TO COOK- As a stay at home mom, I often want to find new recipes based on the ingredients already available to me in my fridge.
2. WORDS- As a young writer, it is important to me that I spice things up. I want to be able to quickly access information about a word I want to use, including other words I could possible replace it with.
3. VIRUS SHIELD- As a novice engineer, I want to be able to easily scan files and documents I may want to upload or copy onto my computer, as the right virus could easily everything on my computer.
