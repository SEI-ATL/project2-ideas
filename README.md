## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://romebell.gitbook.io/sei-1019/projects/project-2) and check out some [examples](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/11-projects/past-projects/project2).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. I wan't to make a list of all the things you might need for a coder set up. I want to use the API of Best Buy: https://developer.bestbuy.com/ and Amazon: https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/ and compare monitors, keyboards, chairs ext. The API's will show the size and monitor campibilities (1080 or 4k), customers reviews, what accesories you will need, and brand reconition. 
2. I would create an website where developers might want to live in the US, it will so job growth and projections, average salary for a developer and cost of living. I think I will use indeed: https://opensource.indeedeng.io/api-documentation/ or google.
3. A website were depending how you start you day, you can choose to start with a quote or a joke. For this I will have to make my own API or https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api
