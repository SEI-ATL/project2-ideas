Stretch Goal
Add in EBay API to sell cards I own and buy cards on my wishlist. Add in other trading cards and sports cards.
2. Sneaker Closet
I want to keep inventory of sneakers that I own and a list of sneakers I want. I'd like to be able to buy and sell sneakers that I own and want.
API

https://developer.ebay.com/
3. Fitness Tracker
I'm a tech nerd and an early adopter. However, I now have fitness trackers from a variety of companies. I want to keep track of all my activity from all these platforms in one convenient place.
