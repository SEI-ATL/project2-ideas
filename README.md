### 1. Discord Emoji Manager
 - API: [discord api](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)
 - Models: Users + Emojis

User story:
 - __Who:__  Users will login and be able to link up to their discord channels/servers by logging in via discord oauth
 - __What:__  They will be able to add, edit, and delete emojis from channels through a simple web app
 - __Why:__ New emojis will go to a library of emojis that will be publicly accessible for users to share and select from.

### 2. Twitter Search Advanced, but easier to use
 - API: [twitter api](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)
 - Models: Users + search history

 User story:
 - __Who:__  Users will login and be able to search old tweets from the twitter database
 - __What:__  They will be able to search tweets in a more user-experience enhanced manner than currently provided through twitter/search-advanced.
 - __Why:__ Easier/improved search functionality. Old searches/search templates can be saved for use again.


### 3. DM search for either discord/twitter/instagram
 - API: [discord api](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)
  / API: [twitter api](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)
  / [instagram/fb api](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/)
 - Models: Users + DMs

 User story:
 - __Who:__  Users will login and link up to their discord/twitter/instagram/fb account (will pick one)
 - __What:__  They will be able to search through their DM history (twitter has a very poor DM search feature). And (if available) make quick replies with emojis.
 - __Why:__ Sometimes you need to search your DM history.
