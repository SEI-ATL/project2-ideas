# Project 2 Planning

Fork & Clone this repo.

## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://romebell.gitbook.io/sei-1019/projects/project-2) and check out some [examples](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/11-projects/past-projects/project2).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. Snky or MyCloset - As a user, I want to be a able to look up sneakers that i have in my actualy closet and add the to a section in the site called "my closet". Here i will be able to give stats about the sneakers, write stories or comments. I might be able to also incorporate another API like BarCode that can take in a image and use it to search a database. (API https://github.com/druv5319/Sneaks-API)

2. MyTify - As a user, I will be going into the site to find a  song and get info on that song. Once i find it i can add to to a favorites list or playlist get addtional info and save a comment about it or a story that comes to mind when i hear a certain song. Kind of like a memory journal.(API https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)

3. neighbourFood - Users will be able to log in and find their list of restuarants they searched for and saved before. This migth be places they went to eat before and can post a story. Similiar to a review sire but more personal for the user. Like a photo book of places they been to.(API https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation?csw=1)
