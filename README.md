# Project 2 Planning

Fork & Clone this repo.

## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://romebell.gitbook.io/sei-1019/projects/project-2) and check out some [examples](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/11-projects/past-projects/project2).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. (I am BRUNING to do this one) D&D 5e character creator and storage. As a user I want a place to create a character for a 5e campaign and be able to have saved multiple characters. As a user, I want to be able to select official character content, or have the option to be able to type in any homebrew data. As a user, I want to have the option to digitally roll my character stats. 
API for Dice: http://roll.diceapi.com/
API for DnD info: https://open5e.com/characters/ DISCLAIMER: This has missing background info but its the most complete one I could find on the internet, and I've been searching for 3 days now. I would need to either have a table for the missing backgrounds, or add info the API (or make my own?)
2. Whats In My Fridge (overdone app, but its an idea) As a user I want to be able to input the quanitity of ingredients I have and search for recipes I can do with those ingredients. As a user, I want to be able to sort through recipies by diet, cultural cuisine, and intricateness. As a user, I want to save my favorite recipies. 
API: https://spoonacular.com/food-api 
3. Mental Wellness (Not sure how easy/hard this will be?) As a user, I want to be able to log my daily moods and outlooks on life. As a user I want to be able to have a daily affirmation. As a user, I want to be able to save the useful affirmations to my profile so I can use them more often. 
API: https://www.affirmations.dev/ DISCLAIMER: it's literally just an API that randomizes one affiramtion at a time. Its not a complicated API and there doesnt seem to be too much to it. This is all I can think of.
