Fork & Clone this repo.

## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://romebell.gitbook.io/sei-1019/projects/project-2) and check out some [examples](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/11-projects/past-projects/project2).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. Forex/Trading site. As a user, I want to be able to login and a see real time price updates (This will be the first API) as well as charts marked up with predictions. I also want to see news stories related to investing or trading (This will be the second API). I also want to be able to comment on posts and interact with other traders.
Price API: https://exchangeratesapi.io/
News Sentiment API: https://finnhub.io/docs/api#news-sentiment
2. Restaurant or recipe suggester. As a user I want a quick and straightforward site to search for a food and return a restaurant or recipe for me. I also want to see what other users have said about the food. Additionally, I want to be able to save my favorite restaurants/recipes.
Restaurant API: https://developers.zomato.com/api
Recipes: https://apilist.fun/api/the-meal-db
3. Christmas shopping site. As a user I want one place to do all my shopping. I want to be able to make lists for the things I need to get and also save deals that I find. Additionally, interacting with other users who can point me to good deals or ideas would be a plus. The API will give access to the lowest prices for a product across all biggest retailers.
