# Project 2 Planning

Fork & Clone this repo.

## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://romebell.gitbook.io/sei-1019/projects/project-2) and check out some [examples](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/11-projects/past-projects/project2).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. An app that randomly recommends vacation ideas. After logging in, the app would use Google Maps API to determine the user's location, then Delta's API to find the nearest airport to that location as well as all flights leaving that airport in the near future, then recommend one of those flights (at random) to the user. The app would help "sell" the user on the vacation destination by providing images of the location using the first images that pop up on Google Images API that happen to match the location. The user could potentially set a max budget to spend on the flight, which would narrow down the search results. They could also set a time window (e.g., flights leaving within a week, flights leaving within a month).

2. A Snapchat-esque app that deletes your messages after a certain amount of time. Used for swapping text messages between users, but the activity log is automatically cleared after an hour (or some other unit of time). Not sure what specific API's I would use for this one. Perhaps NodeMailer.

3. Similar to the above, something with cipher text. The user would type a sentence to send, then the text would be changed to a cipher of some sort, then the recipient would receive the ciphered message. In order to reply, they have to sign up to the site to decode the ciphered message, then they could send a new message back to whoever originally messaged them.

4. Books. Upload a list of your books, then get recommendations of how to sort them (e.g., alphabetically by author, alphabeticallys by title, chronologically by publication date, based on how well they have been rated by fellow users).
