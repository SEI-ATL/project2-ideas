## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://romebell.gitbook.io/sei-1019/projects/project-2) and check out some [examples](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/11-projects/past-projects/project2).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

1. Food Truck Tracker
User createds a profile with specified prefferences (exmaple Tacos).  "Food truck " signs up for a diffrent profile. They list the items they sell that might match user's prefferences. They also share their location (one-time/ they can chage it if they leave their house and go to the office. One-time event - not ongoing) ("ex: Burgers, Tacos"). When they arive at their location they share the location with the  with the app. Everytime new data is submitted(I CAN RUN EVENTS IN javaSCRIPT through a tag in EJS) we will look for USER's prefference mathcing TRUCK's OFFERINGS for the day within the distance between the user and trucks less then (a range we set with the app). Uf the condition is met we will send the USER an e-mail (or other notification) " Food Truck A is at (adress, ex W4th and 6 aves) selling TACOS!) Google Maps API key - might be not free and expensive. <br/>See that it is $10 for a month which is okay. Need to make sure the api does what I want it to do - calculate distance between user and a foodtruck.
